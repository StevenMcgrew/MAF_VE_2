# Mass Air Flow (MAF) and Volumetric Efficiency (VE) calculator

Find it in the Microsoft Store by searching "MAF VE calculator"

Test your mass air flow (MAF) sensor, and check your vehicle's volumetric efficiency (VE) with this calculator. This app is for professional automotive technicians, but can also be used by DIY-er's who have their own automotive scan tool. After collecting some data with your scan tool, just enter it into this calculator and find out if the MAF sensor has a problem or if the engine's VE is low.

You can save your calculations for comparison to other vehicles you check in the future. The local database is empty to begin with, but will be populated with data as you save your vehciles. Your saved calculations are also sent to the global database for everyone to share and search.
